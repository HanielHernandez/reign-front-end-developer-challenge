# Reing Front-End Codding Challenge

Hi, I'm Haniel Hern√°ndez, and this repo contains the code for the Reign Front-End Codding Challenge.

## Considerations

This Project was created using **[vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** which allows incredibly fast compilations times and overall a better development experience, all the styling was done by using **SASS**. options like React Styled Components were considered but in the end, I decided to go for plain SASS just for the sake of simplicity, the testing was done by using the **[vitest](https://vitest.dev/)** which, as the name may suggest, its a test suit powered vite, and like vite it's also blazingly fast and not too resource hungry. A state store like redux could have been used to set up a global state but I opted not to do so because of the low complexity of the app.  
## How to run
