# Reing Front-End Codding Challenge

Hi, I'm Haniel Hern√°ndez, and this is the repo that contains the code for the Reign Front-End Codding Challenge.

## Considerations

This Project was created using **vite** wich will allow us increadibly fast compilations times and a overall better development experience, all thes styling was done by using **SASS**, options like React Styled Components were take in count but decide to opt for plain SASS at the end, the testing was done by using the **vitest** wich its a test suit powered by also vite, and like vite it's also blazingly fast and not so resource hungry.

## How to run

in order to run the project first you must install the npm package by runing the following command.

```bash
npm install
```

then you must start the serve by runing: 

```bash
npm run dev
```
after that a the server will be set up using the following addres http://127.0.0.1:5173/ .

## Testing
if you want to run the unit test created on the project you must run the folling commands

```bash
npm test
```
