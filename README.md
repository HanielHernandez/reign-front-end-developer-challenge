# Reing Front-End Codding Challenge

Hi, I'm Haniel Hern√°ndez, and this is the repo that contains the code for the Reign Front-End Codding Challenge.

## Considerations

This Project was created using **[vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** wich will allow us increadibly fast compilations times and a overall a better development experience, all the styling was done by using **SASS**, options like React Styled Components were take in count but in the end I decided to opt for plain SASS just for the sake of simplicity, the testing was done by using the **[vitest](https://vitest.dev/)** wich its a test suit powered by also vite, and like vite it's also blazingly fast and not so resource hungry. A state store like redux could have been use to set up a global state but I opted not to do so because I cosidered that due to the low complexity of the challenge it was not necessary.  

## How to run

in order to run the project first you must install the npm package by runing the following command.

```bash
npm install
```

then you must start the serve by runing:

after that a the server will be set up using the following addres http://127.0.0.1:5173/ .

## Testing
